        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>

        <li>Picked Plum</li>

        <li>Soy Sauce</li>

    <h2>How to Cook</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop the onions finely.</li>
        <li>Remove the tendons from the beef and beat it with a meat tenderizer until as flat as possible.</li>
        <li>Cover meat on both sides with the chopped onion and leave for 30 minutes or more. Remove the onion and add salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook the steak to your preference(most would prefer medium-rare). Remove from heat and melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a frying pan and fry the onion used for the beef until it changes color. Adjust the flavor with salt and pepper, then move the onion to the steak.</li>
        <li>Melt the remaining butter in the frying pan and fry the sides of the meat before taking it out.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Making the Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add red wine to the frying pan used for the beef to deglaze it. Boil down the wine while scraping off the meat juice.</li>
        <li>Add soy sauce and mix with everything. Adjust seasonings to personal preferences.</li>
        <li>Thicken with dissolved potato starch.</li>
    </ol>
